## Idea

In Puerto Rico there are hundreds of people that want to start a business, a non-profit, a sports league, an educational program and many more different iniciatives. The people that start and lead these projects need help to make these worthwhile projects a success.

This project was created to make the connections between these project leaders and the mentors that can help them succeed.

## How does this work?

Mentors register and indicate what day of the week they can donate **1 hour** of their time to anybody that needs their help, advice, or simply to network.

Registered users (the mentee) that want to connect with a mentor can search for registered mentors and request a meeting. The mentor will then receive an email with the details of the meeting. He will then have the option to accept or reject the meeting.

Meeting can be in a format that is convinient for the mentor. There are a couple of options:

- In person
- [Google Hangout](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/)
- [Skype](http://www.skype.com/)
- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/)
- By phone


## Rules

We have some simple rules that all must accept so that this system can be as effective as possible.

1. This project/service is and will remain 100% free for both the mentors and mentees.
2. If some sort of funding is necessary to cover maintenance cost for the platform donations will be accepted and 100% of them will go to covering these fees and never to the pocket of a person or company involved in the maintenance of this service.
3. 100% transparent
    - All communication about this project will be conducted on some sort of public forum.
    - All document about the creation, maintenance, funding of or any other activity for this platform will be made public without exceptions. This includes contracts, receipts, colaboration agreements, sponsorships, and donations. Everything will be public.
    - The application code will be freely available forever.
    - All registered users will have a public profile where their availability can be viewed. Other information, like usage information, will also be available to help foster involvement and interaction with the platform.
4. Mentors must pledge 1 hour a week to meet with a mentee in a respectable maner regardless of race, color, religion, sexual/gender identity, or social/political affiliation.
5. Mentees must pledge to be respectful of the mentor's time by being punctual and prepared for the meeting. Once the meeting is over it is important for the mentee to complete a review of said meeting. This helps other people know how the meeting went and if the outcome was a good one.

## Danations

100% of the donations will go towards paying the hosting and maintanence cost of the platform. Currently those costs are **$29.00 USD monthly**.
We forsee that this cost will increase with time and we will notify the community when this happens. The goal is to have the community that benefits from this platform be able to front up the monthly costs.
